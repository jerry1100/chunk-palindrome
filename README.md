# chunk_palindrome
A palindrome is a sequence of letters that's arranged the same way both forward and backward.  For example, "racecar" is a palindrome as "r-a-c-e-c-a-r" backwards is still "r-a-c-e-c-a-r."

A chunk palindrome extends this definition by allowing letters to be grouped together into a "chunk."  Therefore, a chunk palindrome is a sequence of chunks that's arranged the same way both forward and backward.  An example of a chunk palindrome is "dogracecardog" where the "dog" part is treated as a single chunk.  Then, the term is spelled "dog-r-a-c-e-c-a-r-dog" and will be arranged the same both forward and backward.
